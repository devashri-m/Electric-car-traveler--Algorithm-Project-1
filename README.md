Electric Car Traveler

Summary:
Electric Car Traveler algorithm states the problem that while traveling through the cities, we need to stop to charge our electric car if its charging is not enough to travel the next city. Also, we will have to refill at the previous station if the current station is not working. We have solved the algorithm in python language. The algorithm gives output in a list ‘result’ for the cities we had to stop to charge the electric car. This will help us when we plan long travel routes and help us identify the cities to stop to charge our electric car.

Description of the project:
We used python for solving the problem statement. User inputs(ie. for total number of miles, number of cities and their distances) are taken by following the given constraints. The city names and the distance between them are stored in a dictionary. And, the output is stored in an list 'result'. Our algorithm traverses from the first city to the last city, where the last city will have zero distance. For example: {'A': 10, 'B': 5, 'C': 0} ie. Distance from A to B is 10, Distance from B to C is 5. We check if we have enough charging to traverse to the previous city if current station is not working.
